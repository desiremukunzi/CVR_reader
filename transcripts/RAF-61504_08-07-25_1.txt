Vagal  Eurorica haze  Cano  Aguamutupula  Or it's mist sort of  Is this haze, fog or mist?  It's not mist  It's not haze  It's not haze  Basically, it's not haze  It's fog and mist  It's almost the same thing  It's almost the same visibility  Yeah  It's fog and mist  Fog is very dense  Maybe you can see more than 1 km  For fog you can see  For mist you can see  Yes  It's the intensity of fog  Fog is more intense than mist  Yeah  What about haze?  The haze is very clear  You can see the haze  It's the result of haze  The smoke is bad  The dust is bad  Then when the sun layers start  It's hard to see  So now  The visibility of haze is zero  What can we do with this?  We can do nothing  Nothing will go  We will do nothing  It's 068hp  068hp  It's fog  It's not haze  We will do nothing  We will do nothing  We will do nothing  We will do nothing  We will do nothing  We will do nothing  This is fog  This is fog  When the wind blows the dust  It will go all the way  So I will give you a pilot.  So Nimbunabili is doable, I will just let you know immediately.  So we took off and then we take fuel, load the cargo, then go.  And then before we take a decision, I will have notified you.  I took off from the camp, the UN camp.  We are now on the eastern part, about five miles to align myself with the approach.  And the sun kind of visibility is less than actually 500.  It was about 300, 200, I forgot now.  Harigi, have you ever worked for Kasselbach for life-saving and you take a decision flying like that?  Because it was a cargo flight and regular passengers.  And then I said, you know, we don't even need to refuel, let's go back.  So good stuff, I was no more understanding.  And then we cancelled, because of our currency, we cancelled due to low visibility below the minimum.  Hariko?  I believe when the visibility is more than four kilometers, it's probably going to be a cargo flight.  So, in Qatar, the visibility is almost zero.  Really?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I think the best place is in Bukirere, where the visibility is almost zero.  No, no, Harigi, come on.  Traffic information from UNOSCA 087HT, we are from Brombeck to Juba, climbing 089A for 170.

So you would say it can get more than 10 km?  It's about 5 km, or about 4-5 km.  Can't be 10 at all.  Just pick a marker.  10 km.  10 km.  10 km.  Yeah, it's more than 6 actually.  Could be 6.  2 miles per minute.  2 miles per minute.  2 miles per minute.  2 miles per minute.  2 miles per minute.  2 miles per minute.  2 miles per minute.  Okay, pink speed.  I'll be honest, I need to be sure of y'all.  I agree.  You'll tell them?  It seems as if you're going there.  I'm reaching overhead in five seconds.  Okay.  Four, three, two, overhead now.  So it's two minutes.  Yes.  Four, three, two minutes.  That's four nautical miles.  That's almost eight kilometers.  Yeah.  Downwards is seven.  So it's above six.  That's why it's okay.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Possible, yes.  Possibility of fog.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Possibility, yes. Possibility of fog.  Yeah, of fog.  Ronald, do you feel the difference with haze?  No.  Haze, no.  That possibility is not there yet.  There is a temperature difference with haze.  But most of the time haze is normal.  It only goes with fog.  Misty, yes.  Mist and fog.  Haze, no.  Yeah.  Yes.  This is actually mist.  Yeah.  No visibility in more than five years.  Before it reaches the ground.  So it stays there.  But that's not haze.  Bigger amount of visibility.  Yeah.  So it stays there.  So it stays there.  No, it's impossible.  For cattle, since it's not haze.  For cattle, since it's not haze.  So it stays there.  Does it look like?  It doesn't even look like actually raining.  It's not raining.  I don't remember quite well.  I don't remember quite well.  So I remember to buy yagui and I took my time to observe.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Usually when it rains, it dissipates.  I don't know if you can see it.  It has dust.  It has a lot of dust.  It has a lot of dust.  There's no wind כל.  There's no wind.  No wind.  Evil moon.  It has a lot of dust.  No wind.  There's no air conditioning.  It has nowhere to go.  It has a lot ofIT has a lot of  There is nothing.  Where is the information?  It is not sufficient.  We need more information.  Meteor is fantastic.  It is very nice.  I really love it.  And the most complicated subject.  Now we are going to  the  No.  It is broken actually.  It is overcast actually.  About 085.  Sky is clear all the way to 065, 075.  I would say.  Sky is clear.  I will show you when it is few clouds.  I will show you when it is scattered clouds.  I think it is overcast.  This is overcast.  Yes.  You can see the whole path.  Yes.  I don't want to say quadrant.  I don't want to be a mathematician.  I don't want to be a mathematician.  I don't want to be a mathematician.  I think it is over 180 degrees.  I think it is over 180 degrees.  It is 0.306 degrees.  I think it is over 180 degrees.  It is over 180 degrees.  I think it is over 180 degrees.  That is why we give it.  It is in visibility.  It is in interference.  I decided to keep RPM in idle.  So,  It is in visibility.  Visibility is in the area  of preparing visibility, the variables.  I think it is in the terminologies.  But I don't have a right to say that.  I don't know the terminologies.  But when I go for English proficient level 60.  I come to level 5.  I use the pure aviation technology.  To get experience than his.  When it goes English.  It is 100% I get 50.  When it goes to grammar.  When I speak broken English.  South visibility is 6 miles. The sky is clear.  So North Cloud is reported below 12,000 feet.  When you are an aviator, this guy is an aviator.  I think you understand what you are talking about.  So please take advantage whenever you see me in this cockpit.  I'm not saying you are an aviator, you are an aviator.  Yeah, I know, sir.  Take advantage.  We have access to the internet.  When I read it, do the thing I'm doing.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying you are an aviator.  I'm not saying you are an aviator.  It means to have a naganya, to have a spinning. How much time we have this?  Metal, quintupleting of metal, quintupleting of tough, quintupleting of windows, temperature off.  All those things man, we need to be able to interpret all those weather.  Thunderstorm is very dangerous. You need to understand the thunderstorm hazards.  The associated hazards are tornadoes, hailstorms, squalor lines, weather phenomena associated with low pressure environment,  weather phenomena associated with high pressure environment, weather phenomena associated with passage of cold front, warm front, whatever.  All those things.  I close my throat.  I close my throat.  How do you maintain the heading? It's kind of a half way.  I'm just turning to the right side.  Less than 5 degrees, travel almost 116 miles to reach Yambio.  So 15 or 20 or 20, 265. I can trim the aircraft and just pick small stuff there.  Then it doesn't move. And then I look out for a while, I look inside.  If I want to fly instrument, I can fly instrument.  It's good to have hands.  So then over, then I feel, when I see the sound, it is more increasing.  It is caused by the rotor system. That is the pitch.  It is the power of the engine. I feel the sound.  The sound is the rotor system in relation to relative air flow.  So we're creating air sound. I'm climbing. I need to push control stick a little bit forward.  And then I continue flying.  I don't lose much. I don't lose much.  It's about the reference point.  That's what they taught you to use, basic level.  It's a combination now.  Of which you are doing.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to fly.  I don't know.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to fly.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to fly.  Should you get used to this instrument?  I don't know.  I don't know what they're saying.  I don't know what they're saying.  I don't know.  So.

If you want to be a test pilot, you need to understand all these mechanics.  You know what I'm talking about?  Just go in the trailer, you go test the machine, I'm going to go test the machine.  Okay.  Give it a lease in Afghanistan.  This is what I'm going to do.  So we're going to go to Afghanistan.  So for these MOT crew machines...  Excuse me.  So this is the place where they come from.  Someone is there to help you.  For single crew aircraft, nobody is going to help you.  The guy with the mechanics...  22144.  That's the guy with the machine and the crew.  That guy is responsible.

We'll have to check Juba before taking off.  Yeah.  Juba is not in the video.  I don't know where he is.  I don't know where he is.  I don't see him on the screen.  I don't see him.  Oh, the time we were feeling,  we were offloading.  I don't see him.  So, we'll do both, refueling and offloading.  All right.  We can do one aircraft, but I think...  I don't see him.
