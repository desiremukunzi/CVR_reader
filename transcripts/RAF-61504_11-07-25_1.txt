Okay.  12,400, 8, 4.  12,800?  12,400, 8, 4.  Okay, 12,400.  Okay, let's say 12,400.  12,400.  Okay.  12,400.  Okay.  400. Okay, let's say 12,500, you see what I'm saying?  Yes, sir.  Okay, good.  Sierra Mama 403, next report, Sierra Mama 403, next report, Sierra Mama 403.  Okay, 12,500, 500, below 1,000, which is 500, QG, go to your chat.  Go to chat, your chat, your chat, okay, okay, what is our velocity in FIX speed now?  Cargo, above normal, takeoff weight.  No, quick takeoff, this is almost pretty close.  Yes, above normal, takeoff weight, below 1,000, VNE is 230.  230.  Yes, sir.  Good, so that means 230 is in red, that's our red arc.  Yes.  Your arc is 220, right?  So we can even go to 210, so 200 is good.  200 is good, yes.  Perfect.  After burning, now here, we also may do another calculation, whether the VNE will shift or  not, that will give us a clearance, either to increase our course speed from, let's say,  maybe 180 all the way.  So I want you also to calculate with the same weight, calculate our VNE at 4,500.  And then from there you will have controls.  Well, at 4,000, the VNE will be 195.  195?  195.  Really?  Yes.  Cool.  At 4,000.  4,000.  So it's between 1,000 and 2,000, so it's around 1,500, 2,000.  Below 1,000, VNE 230, from 1,000 to 2,000 is 195.  So you can't go long over.  Say, 400 years.  So 430, right?  So my average is your speed.  702.  225 or 235?  Yes.  Just take 230 plus 195, that's 220, 225.  See video?  Okay.  So that means the VNE at 4,000 with such a weight, it will be roughly about 215, right?  215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  So 200, 215.  Okay.  So that means the VNE at 4,000 with such a weight, it will be roughly about 215, right?  215.  So 200, it will be Euro arc.  So 190.  It's good for cruising.  Okay.  It's good.  So on our tickers, we have Euro arc.  Oh, okay.  So my chopper, about six miles.  Another one is behind.  So we are good.  This is our position.  This is the second one.  The first one, second one.  Okay.  Thank you.  So if we go up to 4,500 feet, our VNE should be 217.  217.  Yes.  217.  Euro arc about two, zero something, or two zero.  Let me call it from 205 to 210.  Yeah.  So it will be good to cruising 190.  All right.  Then, once ready, 25 miles into the gyro hole.  Let me know.  We will also do another thing.  1,000 feet.  That is about 3,000 feet.  Yes, sir.  And we need to climb to 4,500.  Elevation, tail end elevation, is about 1,000.  1,200.  1,500.  Right, yeah.  So, and we are 500.  And then plus 3,000 will be 5,000.  So we want you to climb to 5,000.  Into gyro hole 25 miles on speed of 1,200.  Today we...  Speed of 1,200.  Yeah.  You will have speed 1,200.  You will climb to 5,000 with a speed of 1,200 on same track.  Elevator of climb.  Yeah.  Three meters per second.  Three.  Okay.  SSLA, when you want to climb, you just check up is clear, left is clear, right side is  clear.  Now I go climb.  Or so we check parameters because we are going to change the power mode.  We are about 21 to 4 more miles to go.  And this is also a good time to make a decision.  Anything that is not good, we shouldn't proceed to bother.  It's good that we return back to Cuba for any emergency.  That requires the ground facilities.  Cuba is the best for now.  When is our no return?  No return.  Cuba bore is 79 miles or roughly.  So about 40 something miles.  It's no return.  We proceed to bore.  That's why you need route Juba bore.  For any emergency that requires run as soon as possible.  We can also try to fly towards wrong or too close to the main road so that we get access.  Then for any immediate landing.  This is also a good place as long as it's the same.  For immediate landing it requires you to land.  But think.  We are going out.  Yes, think because we are going out now.  We are going out.  We are going out.  Juba, you are going out.  124.1  124.1, thank you.  Okay sir, you have control sir.  124.1 is set.  Okay, don't worry.  I have controls.  You have controls.  I have controls.  You have controls.  Speed 120, 3 meters per second, climb, clear up, remember?  Clear up.  Clear up.  Clear left, clear right.  Roger, clear.  Okay, good.  Speed 120, the best climb speed.  Okay, speed is good.  120, climb 3.  3 meters, hold 3 meters, climb.  Traffic 124.1, UNOSCA561, proper helicopter, MIA17, out of Juba for board climbing, level 045, on track of 357.  And we are just checking into the 7 miles out of Juba.  Any traffic around, advise UNOSCA561, proper traffic.  Okay, good.  Sorry.  Okay, now we're coming home.  Okay, let's see.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Juba.  Juba.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Okay, good.  Very good.  Five minute 분染 found, Juba to Juba.  Position 27, outbound 27.  Okay, good.  Concentration on 27, okay.  Don't worry, it's fine, push with that, it's great.  Okay, 5,000.  I know as you're leveling off you can go back to 4,000.  4,000.  Yeah.  Just take 180 for now, 1,500 feet, let's take 192, let's take 148 for now.  You can climb to 1,000 meters, which is 3,000 feet, 3,300 feet, that's almost.  It is possible, so we used 3 meters actually, it has to go to 4 meters per second.  Yeah, I'm going to climb.  Climbing at 4.  Yeah, I'm climbing at 1,000 meters for the best climb speed, 120.  Climbing for 2.3 minutes, at least if you use 4 meters per second.  Okay, now.  Okay, ROT980.  ROT980.  980.  980, good.  ROT980, normal, air gas temperature, normal, air pressure main engine, normal.  Good.  Transmission system, normal, air duct system, normal, no warning lights, all parameters are normal.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So we were right to take a decision.  So you're together with 4,000.  We also call that, to let the traffic know, you could call Mazda Kujera, who is 4,000,  that was a pre-intended flight level.  Yes, also we do in-route check, and then we call.  2400, so just 200 liters off.  Yes, please, in-route check.  In-route check.  96.5, 96.7, good.  All right.

What?  How do you call it? Mist?  It's not a mist, it's not a fog  Yeah, it's a mist that is caused by also  Low-level clouds are one of the causes, it's really awesome, you could  A cloud cloud can overcast about 8,000 feet  When I go overcast, you are seeing this  There's no way you're going to put unusable clouds  However, on the left side, there are still a few clouds  It's a mist  For the sake of a few clouds, there are about 4,000, or 3,500 feet  And then it's overcasted at 8,000 feet  This is a mist, actually  The haremona is cool, but it is actually a mist, it's not a mist  If you want, you can call it haze  Mist is around here  You can call it haze, haze by a dry season, you can call it dry season  Mist, you are close, a little bit closer to the ground  If you want, you can call it haze by a dry season, you can call it haze by a dry season  This is just haze, you can call it haze by a dry season  That's the proper term for haze  This is what causes low-level clouds, when the sun layers are hitting, haze is penetrating  So haze is normal, but you have haze  If haze begins to tell it will boss you and attack you  If you didn't have haze, how can you have haze?  Unless you have haze, you can't write that down  If you don't write haze, you can't write all these things, you will run out of names  The first tectonic word for it is white light  It's good, it's good.  So I'm off with China, I wait, I watch movie, coffee, water, coffee, water.  Okay, go.  China 4 miles.  China 4 miles.  We go to Bora.  Yeah.  Bora 123075, is it how?  Yeah.  123.075.

Quebec is 1017, so waypoint delta, that's the way.  That's our top of descent.  Okay, so from waypoint delta, we'll descend for Laura, we'll set 281.17.  But for now, keeping standard.  I'll go here every year, no?  Every time look at any air in high setting.  In the corner, we'll change one of the settings as standard, yeah?  That'll be much.  150 more degrees, yeah, but I don't know how high it is.  It's around 30 meters.  How long will it go?  It's around 20 degrees.  I'll give it a 1017.  Almost 200, yeah.  I'll give it a 1017.  I'll give it a 1017.  Yes, the fog is a little bit intense in China, but you can even still see it, so this is  good.  Start descending.  This is Alpha Hotel Committee for a short final.  That short final will come in for runway 19.  This is Alpha Hotel Committee for a short final.  That short final will come in for runway 19.  This is Alpha Hotel 19, copy.  Alpha, this is Alpha Hotel Committee for a short final.  I copy that, this time we'll move ahead, waypoint out and top of descent.  Rotor is 96.5 engine range, gas temperature in range, pressure and temperature of the engine is good and rain well range, transmission system is in normal range, autopilot is stable, hydraulic system is in normal range,  no unusual warning light, fuel check.  2200, we're good, remaining with 6 minutes to land, Eric?  We're landing at 36, we're landing at 190.  So we'll slow down and let them go first.  Eric, prepare for landing, we'll be landing in the next 5 minutes.  Eric?  How are you?  I'm good, how are you?
