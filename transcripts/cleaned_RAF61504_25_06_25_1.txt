Okay.  Oh, 20 or 40 minutes.  Yes, sir.  Okay.  It's a cool flight, yeah.  Yeah?  It's cool. It's like an hour. It went like 2 hours and 30 minutes.  And now we're going to have a look at it for a long time.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now one hour.  Now one hour.  Ok, let's have fuel calculation.  Fuel now 2600.  Ok, ready.  How much are you ready?  Fuel band to one group.  So defit demo, 2600.  Yes sir.  So defit demo.  3200.  So 600 off.  Now checking 2 kgs.  About 500 kgs.  Yeah, it's 480 kgs.  So that's 500 kgs.  And then what was the maximum take off weight reaction?  Maximum take off weight.  Was 12, 7, 10.  Take off weight, but you know Van Gogh,  but empty weight plus fuel plus everything.  We had take off weight.  Yes sir.  Not maximum take off.  The take off weight.  300, 300 again.  I took,  I took take off,  take off weight.  Which was 12, 7, 10.  Ok.  Then I deducted 480.  Yes.  So you're ready.  So base camp to 8 fuel.  Cargo also.  It's 12, 681.  What?  It's 12, 681.  1.5 ton.  Now empty weight.  Empty weight,  8,101.  And fuel,  2, 5, 6, 0 kgs.  It's 3, 200.  You knew you had take off weight.  Ok.  It's a good thing.  Even you. Yes sir.  Ok, good. So minus.  480.  12, 200, and 1.  Same appliance to this.  29,  3, 1, 5,  6, 0.  That's the difference.  Yes sir.  So now.  1200. Yes sir.  200 something. Yes sir.  So now.  In actual sense.  According to the weight.  VNE,  195. Yes sir.  Could be about 200.  So you can close  with 190.  We're not going to exceed because we have  good ground speed.  Ok. Very cool.  Next time, so you need to try to organize  my colleagues.  So we change.  If we stick, please  baptize.  It doesn't  affect anymore.  So  I just want to share.  So after an hour, we'll  check again.  So that means  about 30 minutes.  Overhead  Abimlil.  Yeah.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  Abimlil.  The figures.  How you need to  land progressively.  100 miles, 100 miles.  And then till destination.  Yes sir.  We're just calculating.  For the first an hour,  we have banded.  Harimot takeoff climb.  So we climbed about 70 KGs.  Harimot near start up.  Start up for about 150.  So  all those, the consumption could  be less. So if you see  how much cargo  you're remaining on board.  Yeah.  What you got to consume is about  600. So if you add maybe  let's say 150  liters, that's  150 liters,  0.8.  At 70,  220  is 0.8.  170.  176.  Yeah. 176.  So 176 plus 480.  656.  Okay. So initially  an hour  you write down  656.  And then we wait for another  hour.  Okay.  105.  656.  About  150.  About  150.  About 150.  Over start swamp area.  About 150.  Yes, no.  But  fully  rain season. It's  around 160 something.  160 an hour.  And  here  the best alternate  is always  once you click,  is about  70 now.  So that's the best way  to go.  If you click for power,  power is 54.  So power is near.  I call most of the weather  comes from the east.  So  once you  don't find a way, and you  cannot go back to Juba,  the best is room back.  Room back.  This happened to me when I was flying actually  from Venture.  Actually about a bit more  room back, about 60 miles.  So the storm  covered almost my route.  So I couldn't go to  even go to  Juba.  Then I calculated  also going back.  It was a little bit higher.  And then I decided to go  straight to room back. Room back was on my  right side, so it was easy.  You were coming back  to Juba. To Juba, yes.  And then the route storm all over.  That's why you need to look around.  Check your route.  Check also the  route heading to  your alternate.  And always try to assess the weather  every single moment flying  ahead.  Actually the  way that the point of departure  so that it's good to decide  when still time.  You determine the way to go back to your  point of departure or  alternate or heading to your  alternate as early as possible.  If you wait  for too long in the weather  and the weather is moving fast,  it's not  good.  So for every single  15 minutes, I would say  do the weather assessment.  Assess the ground  speed. Assess the ground  conditions.  Pressure and temperature.  Assess the ground.  At least if you are able to  maintain the ground visual.  And then check the wind.  How the trees, the glass,  the water.  Every single moment.  Pay attention  for the traffic  reporting the possible  deviation due to weather.  And if you need to be asked  how is the  weather Juba? How is the weather  Rubek?  If you use  it tomorrow, it helps you to  maintain your situation or any  sense about airmanship.  Now time to  do inflate checks.  Power setting as per graph.  Rotor 96.5 is good.  Stable.  Engine in  normal range.  Power regime is good.  Fuel quantity check.  Fuel quantity check.  Fuel quantity  check.  Fuel quantity check.  Now 24.  Good.  Flight following  2400, also you check  2400 and look the remaining time.  So 1 over 22 minutes, we are good to go.  Normal range. Yes, continue please.  Flight following call.  Flight following call.  I think in practice  this is good to go.  Yes, call.  Yes.  Do I watch the queue with you now?  No, no problem.  Juba Air Ops, UNOSCA  561 Papa.
