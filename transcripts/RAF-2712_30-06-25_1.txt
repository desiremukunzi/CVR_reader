I have a camera, so I can get an answer  Roger  I need to relax a little bit  It's too much on radio  So our takeoff weight, Juba, 12 tons, 378  Good  And VNE flight level 045, 242, VNE flight level 055, 206  VNE 045?  Yes  VNE 045, 217  217, oh that's good  So we'll be able to close at 200 kph, is that clear?  Yes, sir  Good  We'll take 045  Initially, then as we burn fuel, river fuel to Tangiranyi city, Tatmaganaviri  Tatmaganaviri, roger  So after one hour, we access, and then the takeoff weight, you said 12,300, right?  So then you subtract the burn fuel, and then we'll see if we can increase our VNE  But it would be safe if we close to 200, we don't exceed 200 maybe  I have not intended to exceed, so 200 maximum  Yes, 200 maximum  Now 200 miles from Juba  Roger  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  35  Now 24  Juba tower, UNOSCO 5, 60 kph, zone out  Shear that  60 kph, continue 120  Continue 120, UNOSCO 5, 60 kph  Thank you  Thank you  UNOSCO 06, to observe and from Juba to Tariq  Jitayamon and that's on plane 4300, on the track 112  56, open mouth, to run ETA Tariq 07-08, climbing flight level 07-5, traffic MASS 8  Thank you  UNOSCO 1241, UNOSCO 565, traffic Juba to Rupkona  Now show wheel 27 miles out of Juba  One track of 335, to Rupkona  Now crossing 4500 ft, ETA Rupkona 0922, UNOSCO 565, Rupkona  Traffic advisory, this is UNOSCO 560, Papa, in route from Juba, destination Malakar, now tracking  3582 Malakar, now climbing to initially flight level 045  Now ETA Malakar 0905, traffic  UNOSCO 560, Papa  ETA Malakar, so you could do your ETA test, depending on of 60 to lower, we will be sliding for Rupkona  Take down and we will be 025 here  I'll run each other's keys from here into Juba  We are 4 miles south, crossing 4400, climbing 07-5  YN-21, traffic D6, MIA, make it run from Juba, 4-0-M, still on leaving 054  RWY 03, ETA YN-07-02  You can check all of them, can check traffic above, can check traffic below, and then normal.  So you need to see someone above who's conflicting right now.  That's the logic behind it.  It's the same as your descent, you need to see someone below, then normal and close.  That's no problem, it's good to worry.  Most of the time it's normal, but most of the time it's normal.  Throughout the air-climbing and descending, there are millions of people.  That's the logic behind it.  So you need to see someone above who's conflicting right now.  It's going to be like this until midday, it's likely to change around 14 o'clock.  It's a 14 o'clock travertry around midway between the Juban ball.  So we are likely not to be affected, however we might be affected.  That's what we assessed before leaving Malacal.  If not delayed.  I hope not delayed.  Just after landing, process offload.  Door is safe, and you have your truck, you can also refuel.  Kailanga truck refueling, but you are more offloading, so we do things concurrently.  However, there is nothing actually should even push us, make us too hurry.  I would rather make an overnight in Malacal than killing myself.  Do you suggest?  Obviously.  That was doing unnecessary things.  Unnecessary, you just left Malacal with a good weather condition, good accommodation.  And then you end up sleeping in Rumbik, burning necessary fuel, necessary expenses to both  the unit and the UN for whatever reason.  You want to wait at Hakunda, close the aircraft, sleep, tomorrow is another day.  Institution, you are up to invest in the living of Genshin.  You know, you cause this kamikaze decision, it doesn't work.  It's out.  Yeah.  I will climb slowly on close climb.  Roger.  Remember ball frequency?  Yes.  It's good to have ball frequency on.  One, two, three, decimal zero, seven, five.  Good.  Let's have on the second radio.  Go 15 miles to ball, we should be able to switch to frequency and then communicate.  Yes.  Go 15 miles.  Watch your disapparころ.  Good morning.  Extutable footage, good  morning.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Go.  Alpha zero miles to board.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Ah, yeah.  To Vibhuga and there.  Yes, sir.  The weather was like this.  Yeah.  All the way.  Actually, the weather was good from Kigali to Entebbe.  Very, very good.  Then from, mainly the recent one.  And then from Entebbe was good until 60 miles.  And then from 60 miles, it was like this.  A little bit of light rain.  Light rain around, I would say, 20 miles or 30 miles.  From south of the border until...  Actually, it was quite a way, but it would have been about 25 miles.  To Vibhuga.  It wasn't so severe.  I would say navigate the progress.  One, two, four, one.

Good morning, we are now enroute from Juba to Malacal, now showing 1.5 miles Abimur Station.  And we are maintaining battery 045, endurance 3 hours 30 minutes, and we estimate Malacal 0905, and you're in Oscar 560, Papa.  Oscar 560, Papa, copy, we are now in Boro, you're in Oscar 560, Papa, please confirm ETA Juba.  I say again, QNH, Oscar 560, Papa, next report, overhead your station.  QNH 1015.  QNH 1015, copy, Oscar 560, Papa.  For information, Oscar 560, Papa, one zero, not to come as out.  Copy, QNH 1015, not to come as out.  Oscar 560, Papa, one zero, not to come as out.  QNH 1015, QNH 1015, what will be your time overhead ball?  So what will be your time overhead ball?  Yes sir.  So you say smedding overhead ball, this is time...  that helps the situation in the sense of airmanship.  Yes sir.  What is your name? Room for each of you.  9218, discussion. Approaching 140, high knots, perfect temperature.  1015, good night.  1015, good night.  Advice ready.  Followed.  Over.  151, discussion, we'll call you for the next report.  It's necessary, Ushua Panikavarty, it's necessary to report Chang'e City,  and delayed to report Chang'e City,  and report the time overhead, the comparison reporting point, which was this.  Yes sir.  When we have no time for reporting,  I may decide to delay my flight or to slow down on my speed.  Chang'e City, I expedite,  the urgency of my flight.  Yes sir.  Or I request a priority now.  So Ronald, you group in the agency, the menyereye,  the karo menyereye,  do you do nothing at all?  They do nothing at all, each and everything.  In your book, personal evaluation,  I just forgot to check the traffic above,  045, Chang'e City to check the traffic above when I'm climbing,  or traffic below when I'm descending.  It's necessary.  In that case,  it would have been better to check the traffic before initiating a climb.  So even if you didn't check the traffic, it's okay.  Now, today, I learned something new.  I know I learned something new.  Chang'e City, this was usual to me.  So, thank you.  I'm still flying.  I love to be in the air,  in this aerodynamics  and to see how things, why things happen this way.  I don't know if technology is still available.  Also, I tell my mind to assess the weather ahead.  And then, it comes to me,  If it doesn't go the way I planned, will I be back tomorrow, I must say, will it be  okay to proceed?  So it's a continuous mathematics decision.  You've been monitoring for the week, the increase year one, let me put this aircraft  in the cockpit.  Everything is good.  As long as I'm in the cockpit, everything is good.  As long as I reach my destination and back to my point of departure and I'm in the cockpit,  I go to see my pictures on the phone.  Yes, now it will work and record.  I don't think so.  You just say rubble and we'll report.  Yes, sir.  I always say abeam, eastern part, east of the airfield.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  This is UNOSCA 560, papa, now abeam your station, east of the airfield, flight level 045.  Copy that, papa.  Next report, 10 at bound, UNOSCA 560, papa.  Abo.  Yeah, abo.  I'm at the airfield.
