So the first step is 1, 2, 3 and 4, this one is bigger.  So the first step is 1, 2, 3 and 4, this one is bigger.  So the first step is 1, 2, 3 and 4, this one is bigger.  So the first step is 1, 2, 3 and 4, this one is bigger.  So the first step is 1, 2, 3 and 4, this one is bigger.  So the first step is 1, 2, 3 and 4, this one is bigger.  The best way to go about it is to be cautious and always remember the ground.  Always remember the ground and if you are on a high level, you can't make a mistake.  If you are on a high level, you can't make a mistake.  If you are on a high level, you can't make a mistake.  V100 is still push-control stick, about 5-7 degrees.  7 degrees.  Gain your speed.  Gain your altitude.  Atitude 90.  85 missiles theoretically.  90 which gives you speed 120.  And no cars.  Transfer another one.  You can't make a mistake.  If you are on a high level, you can't make a mistake.  No speed landing.  You can't make a mistake.  Zero speed landing.  Atitude 90.  Atitude 90.  Atitude 90.  No speed landing.  You can't make a mistake.  Or you can perform rolling landing.  I will give you the information.  NGG, JAKKNG.  I will give you the information.  JAKKNG, go.  NGG, Ramanuj.  Alatir.  NGL, Alatir.  NGG, Ramanuj, Arabian-Shamanuj.  NGL, Arabian-Shamanuj.  Any change, Kulici?  Any change?  No, we didn't.  Because we are both  Looks like they are waiting for the plane to take off.  I am waiting for the plane to take off.  The crew is calling from the ground.  Can you see them?  They are calling from the ground.  They are calling from the ground, can you see them?  We are doing flight checks.  96.  Engine RPM is normal, 95.4, 95.1, 95.4.5, thrust temperature normal, 0X system is good, autopilot is stable  So, engine pressure and temperature, engine number one, pressure four, temperature one, one, five degrees, engine number two, pressure four, temperature one, two, zero degrees, transmission intermediate, six, two degrees, three, six, zero degrees, main gearbox pressure three, four, nine, temperature eight, five degrees, fuel quantity, check  Check, check  2600, ready to go  Okay, other parameters are normal operations, good, down to seven  So, all good  Okay, right following course  Yeah, so it's simple, we just say engine RPM drops, over the field engine drops, engine thrust temperature drops, main rotor RPM also drops as well  But not that much, one to two degrees, pressure temperature also drops  Sometimes we want by the usual sound, if you want by the usual sound, if we are on the field, the engine drops  If we are on the field, the engine drops, and traffic is about to fall, and then you, you are on the field  And the engine is on  Okay, that's good  Now to the right  And in it, stabilize, just stabilize  Now we are on the right side which I must correct, stabilize the aircraft  Keep the heading  And just push up the wall and then one-and-a-half, I suppose  We lose in the three-meter limit.  Now, Yoko Shonin, what do you think?  What do you think?  But all in all, stay in control.  What do you think?  Gria,  we must develop an attitude.  Yoko was the master,  the king  of the system.  You can do it.  You can do something.  What do you think? Ah, there it is. We're giving it running.  It's arch.  That is a lazy mentality.  So, it's a lazy mind-set.  However,  if we develop it,  we won't lose in the three-meter limit  for crashing.  But why would you crash?  Never develop that mentality.  So, stay in control.  What do you think?  What do you think?  We won't lose in the three-meter limit.  I will control it.  You will land safely.  Develop that mentality.  That's a good idea,  but we have to  resolve  transmission.  Very terrible, completely terrible.  Yes.  Until  we're in the middle of the tarot.  Gria, you're good. Gria, imagine  your performance.  When  I go to simulator,  be challenging.  Now,  I'm going out  of schedule  and  I do  rotation, full down rotation.  Full down rotation.  And the target  is going to land 220 now, Gria.  I'll get up with 50 meters.  Cross throttle.  Zost, upon the arc.  Throttle can cross it, full down.  But we'll cross it  in practice. We'll cross it easy.  It's easy. I'm sure you'll be able to crash.  Great.  It's too much.  I know the  response time  or reaction time.  Forwarding a control stick.  No, because I'm  a collective.  I'm sorry.  I go  to practice.  I'm going to  practice.  Practice makes  the perfect.  Theoretically.  I'm not talking stories.  I'll give you  controls.  I'm ready not to compile this.  Okay.  So, good luck.  So, good luck.  The speed is  1, 2, 4, 5.  I get really  the good job.  Please.  Good one.  I'm going to  play it.  We'll play it.  I'm going to  play it.  Perfect.  Do you have a control?  Yes  Okay  Do you have controls?  I have control  Do you have control?  I have control  No, no, no, can you go this way?  Do you have a control?  I have control  Do you have control?  I have control  Okay  Do you have control?  I have control  When pistons are happy, just turn them to Africa  I already told you, you have to go there  Go all over the originally  Sara, go there  Okay  Do you have control?  Do you have control?  You  I'm going to say with the  Oh  So now we're under it, we see it.  So now we're under it, we saw the rocks is that area.  Now we're going to go through a little air check.  Now we're going to go through a little air check.  And of course it's a system recreative.  And of course it's a system recreative.  One of the systems.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Okay, you can defend when we're after crossing, and hey, Juba, I don't know, you'll find it a little hard to enter.  Hey, shit, huh?  Yeah, a lot of gutsy winds overhead, something's moving in from the south west.  I'll cover overhead, I'll even cross to the other side of Juga.  What?  5, 0, 7.  Eh, I don't know what's happening, I don't know.  Ah, yeah, yeah, shit, huh?  Oh, no, do you see?  Ah, yeah, no, good luck.  Okay, thank you.  I can't hear you, sure, I'll go ahead and cover it, I can't hear 5, 0, 7.  Yeah.  Free 60 miles.  I'll say 55 for now.  So, for now, good day.  We're almost 30 miles to 25.  Yeah.  Siobhan, 1239.
