I couldn't hear anything, I didn't hear anything, I didn't hear anything, I didn't hear anything  I don't know  That's alright, it's not  It's country  Almost, yeah  Got you, yeah  I didn't hear anything, 3-0  Yeah  6-0  North  3-0 or something  Almost north  Yeah  3-4-0, 3-4-0  I recall  Degrees is in one, Nagarini  Nagarini  3-5-0, 4-0  Not 4-0  5 degrees  No, no, no, that's right  Okay  What is this?  Oh  What the fuck is this?  No, it's just, I can't say anything, it's pretty, I have no clue, yeah, right?  1-0, 1-3  Yeah  Okay  Good  Okay, Kurinos is 195  Ah, okay  Once again, 195?  Yeah  Correct, 2000  Checking  3-4-5-0, yeah  System, CMB is at 1-9-9, at 195  Alright, checking, you need to open up again  Okay  C'mon, direct  C'mon, direct  I don't know if you can hear me, I'm not sure, I don't know if you can hear me  I don't know if you can hear me, I don't know if you can hear me  I'm not sure  Uh, Kurinos is at 1-9-9, at 95  Okay  Uh, 6-2-0  Okay, we're going to open up again, I don't know if you can hear me  Yeah, I don't know  And I'm not sure if you can hear me, I don't know if you can hear me, no, I'm not sure if you can hear me, I don't know if you can either  I don't know if you can hear me  Can't hear you  It's not bad, 200 is okay.  Copy.  205 will be an upper order in Europe, huh?  That means it's not granted to the head.  But what we need to do is to prevent it,  because Ushobaraku will prevent it.  Ushobaraku will prevent it any time Ushobaraku jumps.  So 200 is pretty great.  We don't want it to be too much.  It's a good machine.  I like it very much.  Copy, 200, 258, Ecoli Delta Delta India is Ushobaraku.  VNE, I don't know if you can hear me,  but it's called Prakat VNEs.  I think VNEs are the ones that are designed to be used  in the construction of the Ecoli structure.  I don't know if you can hear me.  This is a language,  but I don't know if you can hear me,  because I don't know the language.  Because of the current report,  all systems,  gearbox, shafts,  rotors,  all,  we don't know how to use them.  So if we don't know how to use VNEs,  we don't know how to use them.  But if we exceed VNEs,  it becomes a problem.  If we don't know how to use VNEs,  we don't know how to use them.  So I don't know if you can hear me.  This is a VNE table,  and that's the altitude.  The effect of outside air temperature.  So if you're using it,  you're not going to be able to calculate  in all conditions.  But we cannot keep 250.  We're about to be able to calculate  in all conditions.  After now,  we're not going to do calculations.  But in all conditions,  still,  I got 250, I calculated the VN, I couldn't see the level.  But sometimes you show a group of 300, you look at it and you're wrong.  You're wrong, I can't see the level, 14.7 pounds.  You can't see the level.  I tried that, I found it, but it wasn't big.  It was approaching.  You see the pressure, it's 1013.  Pressure.  You can't see the level.  It's 0.5.  You can't see it.  You can't see it.  It was too high.  It was too high.  I couldn't see the level.  The performance wasn't good.  I looked at the temperature, I couldn't see the level.  I was too humiliated.  Flying level.  You combine aerodynamics, physics of flying,  you combine environmental factors,  you combine.  So the knowledge of environmental factors,  how the environment affects your performance,  both in the air and in the air,  you can't see the level.  So the physics you're flying,  in relation to the environment,  you can't see the level.  You can't see the level.  You can't see the level.  Ты  С  С  С  С  С  С  С  С  С  С  Until later weather conditions show that there is a disappearance.  That is what we expect.  So we will end the video here.  This is the second part of our flight.  Next we will continue our analysis of the environment in Korea.  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  Yes, sir.  Good, good.  We'll take one, two, three, four, one, two, zero.  That's fine.  That's good.  Yeah, that was good.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Good.  So I'll remove my feet after this.  That's all, in that case.  Okay.  I can change pitch around 5 degrees or less, slowly, gently, to keep my level.  And also since the body is centered, I gently turn to the right, to bring back my heading.  I'm just turning, checking the GPS.  And slowly, the water remains in the center, such that I can use a pedal stack, or a neutral pedal stack.  No problem, you can still turn, consider increasing the speed or reducing the speed.  You don't have to consider reducing the speed.  So I'll give you this half water in the morning.  I recall more, the engine is more evident.  I intend to make sometimes unnecessary adjustments.  Also, when I press the autopilot on, it remains in the air heading.  And then I can reduce the amount of necessary work load, to the pedal, to the tail rotor, actually.  I'm not going to go into the details, so that they reduce.  The key pressing is evident.  You don't know, in the grip pedals, the micro switch is sensing,  The active pilot is on, he catches the engine.  Also, the light stays on,  and it maintains the given command.  It's not advisable.  In flight checks.  Power settings as per graph.  Rotor 96.5, engine normal, ground temperature normal.  Rest.  Engine number one, pressure four, temperature one, one-five degrees.
