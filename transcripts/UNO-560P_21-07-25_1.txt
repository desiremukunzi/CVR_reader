Or it could be around 120 miles.  Let's check.  I don't know.  OK.  OK.  Just click forward nearest.  Yeah, click nearest.  Back.  Nearest.  User.  No, user.  User waypoint.  User waypoint.  Yes, forward.  No.  It does like, yeah.  See?  120, 170 miles.  That could be around one hour.  It won't go from now to forward.  Now it's equal.  No.  OK, good.  For one hour.  No, it won't go.  It won't go.  It could be around the UI, actually.  It could be around the UI.  So TLE, we are not like any alien.  I hope it's a workout.  I know.  To get a good 80 miles from Manakala, 80 between 80 and 90.  Check, Nahaqa.  Nahaqa, we are around 90, 90 Naskamana.  Yeah.  So, Nakuwa, this is IOD, actually.  IOD, Niburi, IOD, 2, 3, 4.  Yeah.  So, Kukou, we are by Nahaqa.  IOD, Niburi, IOD, good.  So now, the Airstrip to get to Jahaumuri, IOD.  We have to go to the border.  We have to go to the border.  We have to go to the border.  We have to knock on Mars.  You know, we have to go to the other side.  We have to have a hundred feet of parachute.  We have to try and get to Mars.  I don't know if we can get to Mars.  Uh, two tenses off, I'm gonna go with that, no?  Yeah.  I'm gonna fly away, I'm gonna carry it, it's about 45 minutes 50.  So, no, I'm gonna go, you know, in your area, I'm gonna be okay, yeah, I got it.  It's all good.  We'll see you in a bit.  Friends, uh, huh?  You're gonna be easy, man.  We're gonna get an operator, you know, for a long time.  So, when I lose a signal, like a GPS signal, I maintain my heavy.  I'm gonna get a dupe.  Cross three miles off track.  We're in the wind direction.  Where are we now?  We're just three minutes.  I'm gonna get an operator now.  We're gonna get an operator now.  We're just three minutes.  I'm gonna get an operator now.  We're just three minutes.  I'm gonna get an operator now.  We're just three minutes.  So, it's gonna be, what you do is just try to save altitude, high altitude, out around 9,000 feet.  So, we're gonna get visibility.  Yeah.  I'm making a show on Boniva.  Dupe, I want to see you guys, ISAAN.  I don't know what you're doing, but I just said, I want ISAAN, to get ISAAN, to go back to ...  There was a 50 minutes to go back to report from now.  Then from port to 45 minutes to go back to the dupe.  So, to get the dupe ready to reach again.  Ok, now I'm going to have a future background and start favoring Egypt, then we'll see how it goes, how it goes.  This works with this HSA over-return situation, which is the Angara, which is E.

We are 23 miles, Roosbaraan descent, roosbaraan to zero.  Copy, copy, thank you.  Confirm, Bell?  It's rising.  Actually, it's early.  It's early, sir.  Here you go, sir.  We're not flying yet.  We're not flying yet.  We're not flying yet.  What I mean is, if I go to USA, I won't say any other place that you're flying to school.  I will have to apply to the airport.  I won't tell you.  Any type.  Jet Ranger 206, I won't say 412.  I won't say 412.  I will have to do that.  It looks like a very interesting helicopter.  The same applies to California, with a fixed wing.  Yeah, kind of.  I don't know, but I will say USA, I will come back home with BPL.  Minimum.  How much do you think it would cost to do a BPL on California?  No, not California, actually.  Maybe with a Cessna 172 or more.  About 10,000.  10,000, yeah.  I think we can do that.  Yeah.  10,000.  I'll take loan.  I lose nothing.  I lose nothing.  This car is good.  Flying is good.  Yeah.  See?  I said that.  No, you're not bored out there, controls.  Great, eh?  I think our bell is good.  Augusta.  1190, you can do.  139 is very expensive.  Yeah?  Only a few.  I reckon  on a caravan  on a Navy  system  would be a qualified pilot already.  You would need  less than 30 hours.  Less than 30  hours.  So,  you would need  less than 30 hours.  Yeah.  We're flying a Cessna 172.  Have your PPL ready.  And we're going for a type rating  with your PPL.  It's okay.  Of course,  you need commercial for compensation.  Compensation for  IA.  For PPL, you can have type rating  with PPL.  No issue with that.  No matter.  Actually, it's good.  But  with a caravan,  like studying,  like doing a Cessna,  it's expensive.  Really?  Around $60,000  to have your CPL.  $60,000.  Actually, I will pay  my son.  The young one wants  flying.  I'm just planning for it.  Already planned already.  So, I will definitely pay  for whoever wants to do flying.  I'm really into  flying after high school.  It's something that I need to do.  If it requires me to sell my house, I will.  Coco,  let's do it in this.  Yeah.  I hope you can  come to the site again.  But I don't want to do flying.  I will really pay.  I will  Coco said,  when you think about it,  South Africa could be less.  Less than 10.  When you think about it, if you can pay  maybe  $40,000  to buy a house,  and you can pay  $40,000 to pay for  your kid. I have already said  for my career, I think  it's in this city.  If it's in this city,  it's airline.  If it's in this city,  it's airline.  If it's in this city,  it's airline.  It's airline.  Yeah, I'm surprised.  They call it a pear.  Yeah, a pear.  Have you heard about it?  I haven't heard about it.  Yeah, it's a good flying out in the morning.  It looks like  an  insect  which is made of  windscreen.  It's very white.  It looks like you have  You have less than five seconds. You could go on the air fighter in the near heading.  Okay, sir.  I don't know how our airships are around three o'clock.  Our airships. I believe we're on our way to what?  We're on our way to what to do.  I don't know how our airships are around three o'clock.  I don't know how our airships are around three o'clock.  We're from South Africa only.  I don't know how our airships are around three o'clock.  Yeah, my plan was actually to go on the air.  We would be landing at Palaro.  Of course, we would be landing at the end.  Education and flying.  So, this airship is actually coming.  Goko Aero is planning for my retirement.  I will go to South Africa, have my caravan type rating, and over and over you just go to Cessna.  One month is enough to have your PPL.  Then once you have the Cessna 172 PPL on the type.  Or you just convert to Cessna type.  We are flying Amasa.  Goko Aero type rating.  Of course, we will take you a rough route.  Say, six months.  Goko, nobody will teach me in Meteorology.  Nobody will teach me in Aviation.  You're a political party yourself.  Like at my flight school.  You're going to fix the aircraft.  You're going to fix the aircraft.  But, something like a reduction.  For example, I need your fixed aircraft.  I'm going to get a new one.  I want to do a time.  You know, a new one.  You have to get a new one.  You have to get a new one.  So, you're going to be looking for another aircraft.  Another type.  So, you're going to have to take a route.  You're going to have to go looking for instruments.  You have instruments like a Lomo.  Okay, so we're skipping a basic, intermediate, and then an advanced.  So, Andy, you've got 100 hours.  Okay, so that's 7 hours then.  It's something good.  Oh, by the way, I'm planning.  I think of doing it as a business.  Yeah, you might buy Calabas 40206 or 40208 by then.  I would say, that's it.  We're doing it as normal.  I still have 9 years, 10 years to go.  So we can wait.  We're at the age of 54, 5, 54.  Category of retirement, we are at 55.  We just go home.  We're going to go to the corner.  We just go to the processing.  After processing, you have your project plan already submitted.  Then you buy your assessment.  We're going to do it as an industry.  Yeah, it's pretty impressive.  I think it is descending to land.  Yeah, so we're going to do it as an industry.  We switch to floor.  We switch to floor, yes.  More operations, UNESCO 5604, good day.  Confirm, 560.

The only thing I can teach, I can go teach university, or you go for flying.  That's it.  Impossible.  That was to give me more than what I should be getting.  I should be getting it, I could catch it.  But other than that, I could catch it.  I'm going to call the service guy.  You know what?  I'm going to call the service guy.
