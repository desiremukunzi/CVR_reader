APU start checklist.  Start up Grairion ATC requested.  Request.  Ground crew signal.  APU start.  Okay.  So we'll check the temperature  and pressure of APU and start.  Okay.  So for ground run  we'll just start once we're ready APU on.  We'll wait for a minute.  We'll start the engines, number one, number two.  Just a sequence, one minute.  Once in idle, we check parameters in idle.  After one minute  and then we'll do the right collection.  After doing the  function checks, so  after the function checks, right collection,  we'll write, no, we're not changing parameters,  so all the parameters in the right collection  and I'll put 3 degrees, not everything.  Evo is good.  And then we'll do the flash shutdown procedures.  Ready APU start.  Okay.  So.  Okay.  Noting 680.  Please do.  Okay.  680. Please do.  Let's start APU.  Yes.  I'm going to turn that to  Amiro Ongo,  it turned that.  The pressure?  Pressure 1.8.  Roger.  Continuing the checklist, APU start  done, APU parameters check as required.  Okay.
