We're still 2-4-0, we're still 2-4-0, we're still in RUB-Kona, 11.  We're still in RUB-Kona.  We're still in RUB-Kona.  Speed, you have 200?  Yeah, 200 is good.  Okay, I have 190, so I have to maintain this one.  Yeah, maintaining it, you know, it's good ground speed.  It's 270, to the green, usually...  To the green, yeah.  To the green, yeah.  So you take 230 and 195, that should be 225.  225, you drive by that, so it would be 212.  212, having 200 is perfect.  Kona-Kotasi, exactly, FDR, IFATA, right camera right.  So, in a way, 200.  This is good.  What FDR is picking?  I believe it would be an IFATA instrument.  IFATA instrument, this is the...  From PITOS.  Directly?  Yes.  From the subway, I imagine, it's a good one.  Adyuka, how do you actually read the ALPHA?  No, Kumoka?  No.  This is a great instrument,  this is a good instrument,  so I don't think it would be a good instrument,  if it was a calibration instrument,  it would make a difference.  What do you mean, if it was a combined instrument?  I mean, if you measure it.  This is a measuring instrument,  but if you...  If it's a system sensor, it's a measuring instrument,  but if it was a single instrument...  This is a measuring instrument,  this is a 200,  This is the ground speed.  This is the speed of 200kmph,  which is 195kmph.  So, I can't say  that this is the  picking from the  direct. I can't say that this is the instrument.  Yes, I can't say that  it's the same as the exhaust.  The exhaust is combined  with the  95kmph, which is 200kmph.  It's the picking.  You can't say that this is the same as the system.  It's the picking.  The picking is used to put a  speed of 240kmph.  You can't say that this is a mobile device.  It's the same as a mobile device.  So, the system was  produced in a small way.  So, it's the same as using  Pitot's direct  And Mukurova, the white team, he knows that he must warn you.  You need to hear it.  All red and white?  No, not some, yeah.  If there's any emergency, general action, your pilot or crew members.  So you must take action.  No, no, this yellow one.  It's a cool one.  You might see something going wrong.  Either you're yellow.  Yellow green, it's a green, no problem.  I don't know, no, it's yellow and it's cool.  But it's a yellow-blue one.  If it's a yellow-blue one, take it easy.  Don't worry if it's a yellow-red one.  Don't worry if it's a yellow-blue one.  Just take it easy.  I'm yellow, they're white.  They're white, they're white.  But if it's a red one, it's red, red, red, red.  Take it easy.  For example, you must be calm under weir.  There's no one there.  OK, InfoLight check, SPA setting.  OK, SPA graph.

You continue to fly.  You continue to fly.  The possibility already goes high, it's only 10%.  10 in the engine, 0.5.  So, the criticality of the fight is very high.  I don't know if you understand what I'm saying, but you know what?  If you don't understand the effect of the fight, I will go.  I have the information, you know what I'm saying.  Our understanding and knowledge of the system,  remarkable understanding and knowledge of the system,  was exactly one aspect in which we can make a good fight.  Genetal, I'm going to say, is very high.  Netfire, I'm going to say, is very high.  This is a fight, this is a fight, we don't have a fight.  We have to be very careful, Mr. Nurgos.  This is a fight, we have to be very careful.  This is a fight, we have to be very careful.  It will be a mistake.  This is a fight, we have to be very careful.
